# Desk Sketch

Based on open source CoreXY designs, we had hoped to turn this into a simple DIY desktop plotter.  

Using two Stepper Motors, an Adafruit Motor Shield V1, an Arduino Uno, and a Servo we created a functional design.  When combined with the Makelangelo Software the system was extreamly simple and user friendly.  The laser cut wooden body uses 1/4th inch plywood. Inexpensive rails can be easily worked into this setup.

However, we were never completely pleased with the pen raising and lowering system.  This combined with the release of several other commerical drawbots ultimately lead to the project never getting off the ground.

Maybe someone can redesign the pen lowering and raising system.  Otherwise we hope that this serves as a good example of a laser cut Core XY setup.
